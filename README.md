# Projekt Punk
Hi there! Welcome to the Projekt Punk passion project WIP prototype. The end goal for this side project of mine is to create an FPS roguelike that borrows elements from a few inspirations. Such as, "Titanfall" movement, "Returnal" and "Doom" styled arenas, and a "The Binding of Isaac" inspired perk and item system, to create an absurd power fantasy within each "Run". With super smooth and clean player movement, fully modular gun customization created in a way to allow for ever expansive additions to the weapon, as well as future side/supporting abilities to be created, I want to create a fun explosive mess of projectiles and colours.

While this side project is still in its very early days. I hope to continuously work on it for the foreseeable future! As creating fun things that bring a smile to someone's face is what I love to do most!

*PLEASE NOTE:* In this repo there is also a folder called "Sketches" which contains the artwork and concepts that I worked with some friends of mine to bring to life. I do not claim ownership or credit for the any of the art itself, just the ideas communicated to the artists to bring my vision to a more tangible state.

What you can currently do in this prototype:
Contains a testing level where the user can test my buttery smooth player movement controller to its fullest. As well as test the start of my Very modular gun and attachment/customization system. 

The player movement controller includes the following features:
- Run
- Jump + double jump (or however many jumps you want)
- Booster jump pads
- Dash on ground and mid air (with differing physics)
- Wall ride
- Wall climb
- Wall jump
- Crouch
- Slide (including physics based on the incline/decline of the terrain you are tranversing on)
- Stay crouched under roof

The modular gun customization system includes the following features:
- Base gun object that allows full customization on the gun's current setup, configuration and stats (including all your basic gun stats like fire rate, reload time, etc. As well as some crazy combos)
- Gun combo setup: because it is a fully modular system, the goal is to create a "The Binding Isaac" style upgrade system throughout the roguelike "Run" where your projectiles become ridiculous. Currently, the craziest one you can combine is a rapid burst gun combined with a shotgun shot creating a burst shotgun at high fire rate. The goal is to forever expand this idea and gameplay fantasy.
- Scriptable object pickups that gives full customization to how the pick-up will affect the gun 

Controls:
- Move = WASD
- Jump = Space
- Dash = LShift
- Crouch/Slide = LCtrl
- Shoot = LClick
- Reload = R
